You will find a Blue Topaz example vault (the TIPS vault) here. The TIPS vault shows some theme-specific and novel usages which may help you polish or customize your notes.

And I still recommend you the enhanced edition (https://github.com/cumany/Blue-topaz-examples) created by @cumany, if you are not satisfied with the TIPS vault.
